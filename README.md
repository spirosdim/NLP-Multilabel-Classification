# NLP-Multilabel-Classification
The scope of this project is to apply a number of tools on solving a machine learning problem. The NLP Multilabel classification problem is chosen.

Tasks:
[X] Create the dataset from arxiv (arxiv api, pandas, numpy, sklearn)
[X] Visualize the data (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
[X] fine-tune a BERT family model (transformers, pytorch, pytorch-lightning, hydra) 
[ ] hyperparameter search (wandb sweep)
[ ] inference script 
[ ] Docker file for inference
[ ] convert to onnx
